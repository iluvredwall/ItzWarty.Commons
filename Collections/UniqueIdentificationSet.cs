   /// Represents a set of all unique UInt32 values.
   /// Values can be taken out and returned to the set in a thread-safe manner.
   /// 
   /// Implementation details:
   /// We efficiently implement the UID Set through a segment-based system.
   /// We begin with a segment [0, UINT32_MAX], and when the user requests a new Unique Identifier,
   /// we find the leftmost segment which has size != 1.  That segment is chopped, resulting in the
   /// following segment and non-included value: [1,UINT32_MAX] 0
   /// 
   /// We can continue to efficiently chop this segment: [10,UINT32_MAX] 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
   /// Let's try to return a value (5) back into the set, now.
   /// This is done in an O(N) operation as well; we scan from left to right until we find a segment
   /// which starts with a value greater than us. We insert before that segment.
   /// [5,5][10, UINT32_MAX} 0 1 2 3 4 6 7 8 9
   /// 
   /// Let's return another number, 9.  We learn of another rule: If we are 1-SEGMENT.MIN, then we
   /// update the segment's minimum value.  If we are 1=SEGMENT.MAX, then we update the segment's 
   /// maximum value, in an in-place fashion. The implementation should be careful of overflows when
   /// performing such an operation.
   /// 
   /// If we find ourselves incremeting the end of a segment, we must look at the segment which 
   /// follows (such a segment should always exist unless we have UINT32_MAX freed values).  If our
   /// new MAX_VALUE is equivalent to that segment's MIN_VALUE, our segments must be joined.
   /// 
   /// Overall:
   ///   Initial State: [0, UINT32_MAX]
   /// 10 UIDs removed: [10, UINT32_MAX}        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
   ///  UID 7 returned: [7,7][10, UINT32_MAX]   0 1 2 3 4 5 6   8 9
   ///  UID 6 returned: [6,7][10, UINT32_MAX]   0 1 2 3 4 5     8 9
   ///  UID 9 returned: [6,7][ 9, UINT32_MAX]   0 1 2 3 4 5     8
   ///  UID 8 returned: [6, UINT32_MAX]         0 1 2 3 4 5
